Secondary analysis of "The Development of Gaze Following in Monolingual and Bilingual Infants"

For this project, we utilized the data from "The Development of Gaze Following in Monolingual and Bilingual Infants". This study examines the gaze following in monolingual and bilingual infants. I was interested in learning more about how monolingual and bilingual infants compare in the length of gaze following, along with how age compares to the length of gaze following.

Using the data from the study mentioned above, we analyzed the Western Sydney location. For the first analysis, we ran a repeated measures ANOVA to examine how bilingual infants compare to monolingual infants in gaze following. The second analysis we utilized an ANOVA test looking at age and gaze following with a predictor of being monoligual or bilingual.
